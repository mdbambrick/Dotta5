                                <p>Over 40% of European adults have at least one allergy. Due to resource constraints, many go untreated. EAACI estimates the annual avoidable indirect cost of untreated allergies across the EU to lie between €55bn and €151bn.
                                    Dotta has the potential to reduce waiting lists, to minimise unnecessary precautionary prescriptions such as antihistamines, inhalers and ‘epipens’, to improve patient quality of life and enhance economic performance
                                    (due to higher work attendance and productivity). By releasing allergy specialists in secondary healthcare from routine caseload, not only will care be enhanced, but the pace and quality of research into prevention
                                    and therapy should improve.</p>

                                    is cheaper and healthier. Finally, by participating in the monitoring of outcomes, you can improve the prospects of successful therapy for you and others.</p>

                                <p> Current recommendations include:</p>
                                <p>
                                    1. If possible, breastfeed exclusively for first 6 months (and then continue to 12 months)</p>
                                <p>
                                    2. At weaning, from around 6 months include some pureed solid foods known to cause allergies (e.g. cooked egg, peanut, cow’s milk, Weetabix, hummus, mashed fish/seafood) – avoiding such foods tends to increase risk of allergy and therefore is now regarded
                                    as generally counterproductive.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Exceptions – if your baby has already been diagnosed with an allergy or has severe eczema, take specialist medical advice (and otherwise avoid the allergen).</p>
                                <p>
                                    If an allergic reaction occurs within 30 minutes of eating, observe closely and if anaphylactic, dial 999 (this is very rare).</p>

                                <p>One key is better managing infant exposure to allergens. Allergies reflect an misdirected autoimmune system. A major key is to stimulate and challenge the auto-immune system in the first 12-18 months of life. </p>
                                <p>
                                    Overly cautious parental attitudes to hygiene and foods may have contributed to increasing allergy rates. </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the other hand, parents and carers need to be observant to ensure that quick action is taken when the very rare anaphylactic event occurs with an infant, and also to avoid this strategy with infants that have severe eczema or an existing allergy.
                                </p>

                            <wm-accordionpane name="accordionpane23" title="Treatment - What are the treatment options for allergy?">
                                <p>Historically the main treatment is avoidance, and that remains the default approach.</p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, where the allergy is severe it is important to have rescue plan, which usually entails maintaining an accessible supply of auto-adrenaline injectors etc.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Going forward, desensitisation therapy will increasingly be developed that allow patients to get over their allergies.
